       "[\" what's up everybody peter mckinnon here welcome back to yet another video and folks today we're talking about the canon r5 [Music] the highly anticipated much discussed rumored all the buzz and for a very good reason because this camera delivers i couldn't be more excited about it now before we dive into this thing and i talk about my experience and show you some footage because i have been shooting with it for a few months now canon sent me this camera on loan i'm giving it back actually in a few hours to test out basically in the middle of the pandemic but i want you to know too right at the beginning i'm sponsored by canon i'm an ambassador for the brand i'm a canon shooter i've been a canon shooter my entire life i've been shooting canon since i bought my first professional dslr that's about 15 years now i've been using canon products so keep that in mind when i'm doing this review i'm not going to be unfair about it if there are things i don't like about it i'm going to tell you but luckily for this camera it is exceptional and there's not a whole lot of things that i don't like about it so you're excited i'm excited let's talk about one of the biggest camera releases of the year of the is it of the decade could we say decade it's one of the biggest releases for canon for sure this is back to the 5d mark ii days let's talk about those days for a second hands up who remembers a filmmaker by the name of vincent laforay amazing made a film called reverie back in i'm gonna say it was like november 2008 with the 5d mark ii now this was one of the first times we'd seen cinematic looking footage with depth of field shot on a dslr that was a big deal then you had heavy hitters like philip bloom coming out with incredible courses on how to use a dslr as like a filmmaking camera in the right settings and the accessories and that will always be a staple in my mind learning from him when i was much younger that was a big deal for canon that was a huge camera release the 5d mark ii the r5 i feel and i think a lot of people would agree with me the r5 is that big deal of a release now for canon let's talk about why this camera is important why people are talking about it where all the buzz is coming from let me show you how this thing works there's the top down angle you've got your flip out screen that we've all come to love the body's a little bit thicker than the eos r not by a whole lot but that's obviously accounting for the new in body image stabilization the wheel is back the joystick is back the functionality that a lot of us are used to coming from the dslr side of things it makes it faster easier to use it just feels right here's something that'll make a lot of people happy dual card slots you've got a spot for a cf express which is the new type of like high-speed car that this thing's taking and then you have an sd card slot it takes the same lp e6 batteries that we've all have like 100 of so that is a massive benefit now there are new ones they've got this little sticker on them that's kind of how you're able to differentiate the new ones from the old ones and apparently it's just the software and the cameras is able to use this battery to just distribute the power in a more efficient way it's not necessarily that the battery's bigger and giving you more battery life but the camera and the software now is smarter and it's using these batteries better than the old ones same chargers that's good all right so taking a look at the difference in comparison of size to the r5 and the r here they are with the back button layout like i said this bar is gone you get your joystick here instead of your directional kind of d-pad sort of control you've got the wheel and other than that they look pretty much the same this r5 is just a little bit thicker so if we look at them both side by side a little bit fatter grip's a little bit bigger we flip them over on the sides this side right here is a really good representation of how much thicker it is most of everything in the same place another top down honestly in my opinion it feels better ergonomically so now you've got ibis in the body you've got image stabilization in the lens those two things working together to get you some super stable footage something people have wanted for a long time it's one of those instances where you're reading the stats online and you're like this can't be true is this right does this do 8k raw c-log with autofocus 4k 120 yep i mean when we're even looking at all the modes on this camera as far as how they're represented within the menu canon's menus have always been good but the ui within how to get to different frame rates and resolutions has been improved even more now they've just broken it down into three menu options basically it's very clearly broken down here which makes it a breeze to just go boop boop boop and you know exactly what you're setting now to get that high frame rate you're still going to go over to the other menu hit high frame rate enable that's going to go into 4k 120. photographers 45 megapixels right i've been shooting on 20 megapixels with the 1dx mark ii for like a good quarter plus of my entire career so 45 megapixels that's great that's some high-res stuff right there one of the things i love i love the shutter sound and click of this camera that's a big thing if it's just like a nasty shutter sound and click can't do it this that's subtle check this out shutter mode electronic listen to this everybody just shot like 15 frames there's so many times in photography where that shutter sound can actually be an issue wildlife photography for example if you're someone that's camping out and you're waiting for a hummingbird or you're waiting for an animal gone with this you're not even sure if you shot the frame it's so silent so that is amazing you're shooting live events weddings any type of thing where people are talking and the focus is not on you it's on something else and you're needing to photograph that without being a distraction amazing frames per second wise this thing is fast you're going to get 12 frames per second mechanical you're going to get 20 frames per second when you're in live view so it rips in live view mode one two three see the border right there see that white frame just freaking out that's how fast it's shooting that was a hundred and thirty photos i just snapped you heard nothing that's got to be one of my favorite new features because i used that on the 1dx mark iii constantly you're dropping something in a tank of water you're shooting john hill do a fakie 360 flip nose grind into a kickflip manual and shove it out switch you want to capture these moments without having to worry about like did i get it in frame 20 frames per second if you didn't get it in frame there's a whole different issue so let's talk about my experience using this r5 since pete you've clearly had it for quite some time now tell me what it's like i know the specs i see them i've read them all those things how is the camera dude how is it i'll start by saying i got this camera like in the thick of the lockdown i didn't get a chance to use it as much as i wanted to because parks were closed trails were closed no one was going outside so a lot of the use that i got from the r5 at the beginning for like the bulk of the time that i had it in my possession was stuff at home photographing the pets photographing the kids doing things like that around the house things that you do when you first get a camera at home and you open the box and you're like uh come here boy it felt so good to shoot 120 frames per second again used it all the time on the 1dx mark ii got used to shooting 60p on the eos r but it was really good to shoot in 120 again and remember how good it looks and how good it looks in 4k insane now the version i have is a prototype version it's not a finished production version that's why it has the words sample on it and this is the one i've had for a few months so there were some quirks and things to it that i think will be ironed out when the launch version comes and there was also a couple things that i was unsure of example if you're shooting a lot of 4k 120 sometimes the camera starts to overheat and gives you that overheat warning just so that the things inside don't melt and it doesn't get destroyed when you think of a cinema series camera like the c500 and up those all have huge fans built into them but we're talking a mirrorless camera here this is this is very small this little thing doesn't have two giant fans cooling it down the entire time so it gets hot of course the more shooting that you do you're gonna have to wait so it makes sense to me that it overheats based off those settings that you're shooting at for me though that is one of the downsides i understand having to wait for the camera to cool down i don't want to wait i just want to keep shooting i don't think there's there's x if you shoot this much you have to wait this long because it's all situational it's gonna depend on different conditions are you shooting in the jungle where it's super hot and humid and all you're doing is 8k and 4k 120 are you shooting in the arctic where it's the complete opposite are you not shooting much 4k 120 maybe just a few clips here and there you're never going to have an issue so it all depends on the project the place the conditions it's entirely situational but it is one of those things that you're gonna have to keep in mind when you're shooting just in case i don't think it'll be anything drastic or anything to really worry about it just makes sense to protect the camera from the inside so the whole thing doesn't melt because let's be honest this tiny little package right here is shooting 8k raw which is incredible for a little mirrorless camera magic it looks like we're shooting on a cinema camera it looks that good so we were just incredibly impressed and inspired having that kind of quality in a tiny body like this plus getting that dual pixel auto focus being able to do all of those types of things that we typically want to shoot without having to worry about pulling focus like you do on a cinema camera being able to have that 8k feature that 4k 120 in log mode while still taking advantage of the dual pixel autofocus system that's that is huge that's massive that opens up so many doors you basically don't even need a gimbal when you're using this camera obviously gimbals have their place depending on the types of moves and types of shots you want to do but for the most part i always try to get away without having to use one without having to bring one an extreme example of that is a few weeks ago i was hanging out the side of a razor side by side with the pro driver up north he was going like 130 140 down this crazy dirt road and drifting corners and i was just hand holding this with one hand because the other was holding on for life and i was trying to vlog that whole thing with the ibis with the image stabilization i mean it looks fantastic and that's not even in slow motion i i don't see the need to even bring a gimbal when you travel or any of those things it's it's just so good let's talk about the price you're looking at for the body only 52.99 now that's canadian dollars that's important to say if you're watching this anywhere else do the math look it up that is a good price to get a camera that packs as much punch as a cinema camera in a lot of instances in a package this small think about travel think about portability you can take this anywhere this flies under the radar this doesn't look like you're shooting professional looking 8k raw footage you get a big cinema camera you go in somewhere sorry that can't whatever you guys are doing in here it's not allowed it's a school project no it's not a school project this is going to get into those places this thing is portable it's small it's inconspicuous a camera that's over five thousand dollars is not a cheap camera by any means that's a lot of money given that i think it's warranted based off what you're getting inside this if that's out of your wheelhouse don't be worried there's another option for you that's the new r6 camera now if you want to learn more about this and the cost and all the features and things compared to the r5 you can watch this video right here so the fact now that i can shoot a vlog in 4k at 10 bit 422 internal the amount of information that this camera is recording it looks like i'm editing cinema camera footage that's because this camera packs so much inside so i've had people ask like will you be switching to the r5 and yes i'll be switching to this camera this will be my new main driver daily driver travel camera if i'm vlogging if i'm making short films i'm gonna be shooting them on this because it packs so much in such a small footprint and there's so many things in here that i've been waiting for in a camera for years well done guys seriously well done all right guys so that is it for me that's your first look at the canon eos r5 from someone that's been using it for a few weeks and had hands on for a few months now i hope you got something out of that i hope that was a good representation of the camera you got to see some of the specs you get to see some of the footage used what it looks like what it looks like uploaded to youtube after it's been compressed all of those things i hope it was helpful and i hope mostly that you enjoyed it so thanks for sticking around i appreciate you watching and thanks to canon for sending me those cameras early i had a blast i'll see you guys in the next one peace when you hear the word artist you might think of a painter a museum fancy degree when i hear the word artist i think of my friends the local restaurant owner a little kid sitting under a blanket with a flashlight dreaming of the stars [Music] you\",\n",
       " \" so if you're looking to buy a Canon mirrorless camera chances are you're looking at either the Canon R5 or R6 now I use both of these cameras in combination so I know that ins and outs of both cameras I know which camera I often reach for more often than not and I also know which camera I often recommend to others spoiler alert they're not actually the same camera to give you a bit more background about me I've been using the R5 literally since it came out and I then added the R6 a little while after to my kit I've used them both for all sorts of Photography from weddings to street photography landscape portrait so video wise I use them both for client work I've shot a few weddings with them but generally I mostly use them for this YouTube channel on paper you'll find a number of differences in these cameras some of which to me really aren't that noticeable in the real world but overall I'm going to only give a point to either camera for anything that really stands out as a key difference things that actually matter when you're using these cameras as points will be weighted differently depending on you and what's important to you stay to the end where I will give an overall summary and look at these key differences ultimately so you can decide which one's right for you let's jump in so firstly looking at size and appearance so these cameras are pretty much identical in size but we do have the R5 Just slightly heavier for some people this extra weight is actually nice to counter some heavier lenses but overall 58 grams one way or another isn't enough of a noticeable difference to really give me a point to One camera either way personally in hand I probably prefer the R5 but this could actually just be because it looks a little bit nicer with the extra top screen instead of the wheel I know some people actually prefer this wheel though so again not enough to to give a point either way also on appearance taking a quick look at the LCD screen and also the viewfinder the R5 clearly wins on paper with a much higher resolution on both and also a slightly bigger LCD screen however the R6 well it's still more than good enough in my opinion don't think for most people is really enough to consider one camera over the other so again no points here but consider what is important to you next up looking at image quality and in this category we do have a clear winner and that ultimately comes down to a higher resolution the R5 you will get much more detail in your images as you would obviously expect it also gives you the ability to really crop in on your photos and also allows you to actually shoot in a times 1.6 crop mode that almost gives you the same detail as the R6 which is a really nice feature when wanting that little extra reach especially with any telephoto lenses that in mind for a large percentage of people I do think 20 megapixels is actually more than enough if you do want to blow up your images larger there's even technology like adobe's super resolution that seems to work pretty well when you do need it also here keep in mind the much larger files you're getting from the 45 megapixel R5 for some people this could actually mean a bit of a win to the R6 but for me just because the options it does provide here of course I'm giving a point to the R5 next up we have price here I'm not only looking at the overall price but also the value for money now of course there's a clear winner here and that is definitely the R6 in USD you're looking at around 3 800 for the R5 and only about 2.5 for the R6 price difference that really just isn't worth it for a lot of people people if you also want to get the most out of the R5 remember you are going to need a CF card that isn't cheap either this is required for both 4K at 120 frames per second and also 8K it will also increase the number of shots you can shoot on burst mode so for overall price and value for money I do think the R6 makes a lot of sense for a lot of people so that's a point to the R6 next up we have two categories that don't really differ too much so I'll run through them quite quickly that is the autofocus and also the Burst Mode capabilities so autofocus we pretty much have the same systems and honestly after using both cameras I haven't found any differences with the R5 and R6 they both have really amazing AF systems that are a huge step up from anything I've used previously and will really hit the mark for pretty much all Shooters which leaves not much else to say on this category and again nope points to other camera in terms of burst modes again kudos to Canon because they haven't deliberately crippled the R6 in this category with both cameras you'll get 12 frames per second with the mechanical or first curtain shutter and then 20 frames per second with the electronic shutter that said I have looked at a few tests and you'll actually get longer burst rates from the R6 but notably here the number of shots you can still get on the R5 with such large files is actually really crazy and I can't think of a situation where you're going to need more so again no obvious points to either camera here moving on to the card slots and there are some key differences here but these differences will largely come down to the individual yes the CF card slot in the R5 allows you to shoot these huge files in burst mode for a long long time shoot 8K and even shoot 4K at 120 frames per second but actually having two SD slots in the 6 is probably a big win for most people to be honest because you're going to save money and you don't have to carry two different types of cards around with you again I'm not going to give a clear winner here as it will ultimately depend on the user moving on to ISO and low light performance so in this category again we have a clear winner and surprise surprise with its lower megapixel count this is actually the R6 without pushing the iso to crazy numbers for such a high resolution camera the R5 actually performs really well but from watching many many tests of this it is clear that the R6 does win at those higher isos so here the R6 is the winner but consider whether you use your camera in those High ISO situations you might shoot mostly in a studio at low isos then it's not going to matter at all to you but just for that capability here I'm going to give a point R6 moving on to image stabilization and both cameras do have the same system so again no points to have a clear winner here definitely having that inbuilt image stabilization is a really nice addition to both these cameras moving on to battery life and again actually the R6 because the R5 is so powerful you're going to get more shots out of your R6 than your R5 If this is super important to you often people will use a battery grip anyway perhaps if you don't want to use one you will get about 40 extra shots on the R6 yes this is nice to have but for me using both cameras I haven't really noticed much of a difference to be honest just from day to day use so I'm not going to give a point here to either camera moving on to weather sealing and build quality now the R5 is slightly sturdier built which you won't really notice holding them in hand they both feel really well built and sturdy and they both do have weather sealing looking at the weather ceiling I have read articles tearing apart the R5 and the weather ceiling is actually really really good the R5 is more on par with the old 5D line while the R6 is more in line with the last 60. so overall I obviously have no data here of my own I'm not going to throw my cameras into water to find out but I have used both in rainy conditions with no issues but just because it's meant to have slightly better weather ceiling and a slightly stronger build quality here I will give a point to the 5. taking a quick look at overall reliability and also overheating now both of these cameras are super reliable there's no questions there and if you're shooting just Stills overheating is nothing you even need to consider for me as a hybrid shooter living here in Sydney but also traveling around a little bit the overheating has never actually been an issue on either camera for me event shooting video I think this is only going to be a big issue for you if you shoot really long form content or shooting 8K or really smashing the 120 frames per second 4K maybe if you're in a really hot environment I can't see this being an issue for you keep in mind that the R5 you can actually shoot the regular 4K footage unlimited by overheating this only becomes an issue when you put it into the high quality 4K mode or shoot at these higher frame rates or 8K the R6 on the other hand it does overheat in its regular 4K mode if you shoot for long enough so here because you can have that option to shoot unlimited 4k on the R5 I'm going to have to give a point to this camera alright moving on to video now before we wrap up and look at a summary and this is where the R5 starts to stand out a little bit more so firstly looking at video modes and video options the R5 does give you more shooting options with both ipb and all eye compression options which will be important to some people if you don't know what I'm talking about here maybe it's not important to you but keep in mind this can also depend on your computer as some may have issues reading the more compressed files with the R6 you only get this compressed ipb files so this may be an issue for some people depending on how you're editing obviously we also get 8K capabilities on the R5 plus we get 4k at 120 frames per second a okay for me I'm not really using but 4K 120 I do use a lot of so the R6 has a max out of 4K at 60 frames per second but you do get 120 frames per second in 1080 which is still nice to have but here again that's another Clear Point to the R5 so my last video point is probably the main reason I actually pick up the R5 over the R6 whenever I'm shooting video and I haven't heard too many people talk about this and that is actually the ability to use custom video modes because the mode setup is totally different on the R5 you do have the option to set up your custom saved video modes which I have set up at 4K 25 50 and 100 frames per second all ready to go with the right shutter speed honestly this saves so so much time and once you've had it there to go back to a camera without it it is really quite frustrating you can still use custom modes for photo on the R6 but personally I mostly only use these custom modes when it comes to video so that's another small win but another point to the R5 alright so let's take a look at these final results and more importantly how these results may affect you we have the R5 clearly on top but again we need to weigh up that these points that I have given out may not have equal weight depending on what's important to you if we look at these results before we got to video it was actually really even to me the R6 winning on value for money and low light performance while the R5 stands out really for its larger resolution and possibly for some better weather sealing so if you're looking at these cameras mostly for photography it really comes down to price versus megapixels and this is why for such a large percentage of people I actually recommend the R6 over the R5 If you are a hybrid shooter much like myself this is definitely where I'm going to recommend the R5 If both cameras are there and I know I'm shooting video well I always pick up the R5 but again really consider how important these extra video options are for you A lot of people don't need 8K a lot of people don't even need 4K 120 so perhaps the R6 may still be the better option for you alright thank you so much for watching please do subscribe to the channel I hope this video was useful and you've made your decision I don't think you'll be too disappointed either way keep on creating and keep on growing my friends I will catch you in the next one bye for now\",\n",
       " \" what's going on guys in today's video we're going to be talking about the canon r5 more specifically i want to talk about some things that i wish i knew about this camera before i purchased it now i've had this camera now for about eight or nine months i actually picked it up on launch day so i've been using this thing for both photo and video for almost a year now so i definitely have some strong thoughts on it now i don't think there's any question that this is one of the best cameras out there on the market right now it's definitely marketed as kind of an all-in-one it's exceptional at both photo and video and i would agree with that especially on the photo side of things i honestly don't have any complaints but being somebody who does a ton of video work especially here with my youtube channel there are some things that i definitely wish i knew about it before i decided to purchase it or maybe some things that you should at least consider before you buy this camera for yourself now the first thing that i wish i knew about the canon r5 before i got it for myself was the ibis wobble now in case you don't know what ibis wobble is or ibis itself ibis stands for in body image stabilization which basically means the sensor in this camera body is floating which what that allows you to do is when you are holding your camera handheld it takes out some of that natural handshake because the sensor doesn't feel every little jitter which is actually amazing for photography especially if you're shooting on longer lenses but the drawback of it when the ibis is so strong like it is in the canon r5 is you get this weird warping effect whenever you're filming at a really wide angle now i'll insert a clip or two in here so you guys can see exactly what i'm talking about if maybe you aren't familiar with this all right so i have the ibis turned on with the image stabilization on this lens now you guys tell me like i said some people out there are saying that this is no longer an issue it definitely happens when you kind of have to go back and forth real quick but that happens when you're filming so it's an issue in my opinion and you guys uh be the judge let me know in the comments below do you still see it because uh i sure do and i think it looks absolutely disgusting like i would not feel comfortable even using a clip with this warping effect on my youtube channel let alone with professional works or with clients at all now currently canon doesn't allow you to turn ibis off in the camera i pray that someday they add a firmware update where you can just turn it on and off in the camera but as of now you can't so there's only one way to do it so if you have one of these newer lenses from canon like i do the 15 to 35 it's actually an image stabilized lens so the only way to turn off ibis in the camera body on the r5 is if you have an image stabilized lens you turn off the image stabilization you turn that off that will also turn off ibis in the camera body as well so that's pretty much what i do whenever i'm vlogging or i'm doing anything handheld which a lot of my content i am all the way out at 15 so it's kind of an all or nothing you either have both of them turned on and you get that warping effect or you turn it off and you lose the ibis in the camera and you lose the stabilization on the lens which is honestly a huge bummer and a really big issue for me because the 15 to 35 is such a nice lens and part of the reason why it's so expensive it's around 2 400 usd is because it's a wide angle zoom that has image stabilization on it so the fact that i have to lose that is honestly a giant disappointment now i will say a lot of times if i'm shooting b-roll here in my office or something like that if you're punched in i would say pretty much anywhere over 24 millimeter especially all the way in at 35 or further you aren't gonna have any issues you can keep the ibis on in the camera and it's really going to help smooth out some of those shots that issue right there really upsets me about this camera it's probably my biggest gripe because it's just really unfortunate you pay all this money for this setup and this really amazing lens and then you just have to lose some of the upsides of it to just not get this crazy looking warping now next thing i want to talk about that you should consider about the r5 which is probably no surprise but i do want to address it and that is going to be the overheating now as i mentioned so far with the canon r5 in the first nine months we've had one firmware update which allowed the overheating meters if you want to call it that to be extended a little bit so honestly it really did help out quite a lot i experienced a little bit of overheating before that firmware update came out but after that firmware update honestly i've never had this camera completely overheat on me now you should keep in mind that i am pretty smart about how i film with this camera so i film all my stuff with this camera in the normal 4k i don't use the 4k hq because i know that eventually it will overheat in that mode i'm not shooting 8k um i really picked up this camera because i want to film everything in 4k whether it be 24 frames per second slow motion 60 or slow motion 120 i wanted to be able to film everything in 4k and honestly for me the normal 4k the non 4k hq still looks extremely good in my opinion now most of the time when i'm using this camera it is for my personal work for my youtube channel so a lot of times i have a sit-down interview style video like this where maybe i'm filming for i don't know between 20 and 45 minutes i guess depending on what the video is like and then after i film the a-roll i will then shoot some bursts of b-roll whether it be in 60 frames per second or in 120 frames per second so in that mode that's when i start seeing that timer for the overheating to start turning down so it's currently fine for me but it does make me a bit nervous sometimes and one thing i want to say about the overheating is like i mentioned i use this canon r5 mostly for my personal youtube channel here without a doubt if i was on a job or i was hired to do a job for a client where it was really important or for a good amount of money as much as i love this camera i wouldn't feel comfortable using this i would either need two camera bodies or you have to feel comfortable enough with the clients to say hey sorry we're gonna have to let this camera cool down and we can uh resume shooting in about i don't know 20 or 30 minutes so i don't know about you but i definitely do not feel comfortable doing that if it's just a camera you're gonna be using for yourself no problem but if you're like shooting weddings or with clients and you have moments where there's no way you want to miss it this camera probably isn't for you and that honestly sucks to say but it just really is at the end of the day what happens if you have to worry about your camera overheating now without a doubt i think the ibis wobble and the overheating are the biggest issues for me that you should consider when buying this camera there definitely are a couple other things as well one of those is the video files out of this camera are extremely clunky and tricky to edit with because of this certain codecs and the way this camera records 4k files it uses a compression that is h.265 instead of what the typical is in the past which was h.264 which i'm trying not to make this crazy technical but basically it just uses a newer compression method because the files are so large it basically destroys any computer that tries to edit this footage without making proxies now i myself i edit all my videos on a mac so previously i had a 2018 macbook pro that was fully specced out it could handle anything that you threw out it especially 4k footage but with this footage it destroyed that computer so i actually upgraded to one of the new m1 macbook pros but the new m1 max have this voodoo magic that they do to basically unpack this h.265 files really easily so with other people's testing this plays back super easy in davinci resolve and also in final cut now i myself along with i would say the majority of people out there still i'm a premiere pro user and as of now i'm filming this uh mid-march premiere pro still hasn't updated their system for the m1 computers so for now i still have to make proxies but hopefully premiere pro once it's updated for the m1 is going to be able to play back these video files smoothly without having to make proxies or anything like that i can't speak way too much from the pc side of things because i don't edit any of my footage on pc but from what i know it's still been an issue for a lot of other users that i'm friends with and that i've talked to so just keep in mind that you are going to have to add in some time to make proxies for a lot of your footage if you're shooting with r5 especially if you have any sort of an older machine or anything that's not like super high performance so last thing i would really tell people before they decide to pick up the canon r5 is i want to touch on the 120 frames per second footage in this camera now i personally think the 4k 120 out of this camera is extremely high quality i know some people have said the opposite of that before but i honestly just strongly disagree but shooting 120 in this camera there are some weird kind of quirks that you should know come with it you get absolutely zero audio recording which that might not be super important to you depending on how you film or what you're actually filming but there's been situations where i've worked with other people and you know i switch over to my slow motion mode and 120 and then something happens or if they say something that you can't replicate and you miss that moment and you just have to live with that fact so it just kind of comes with it if you shoot 120 in this camera you are going to have no audio so you just need to keep that in mind there is actually one other really weird quark and that is once you film that footage you load it up to your computer put it into your editing program it actually spits out that file as a 30 frames per second file now if you're someone like myself all of my projects are in a 24 frames per second timeline that is how i record all of my a-roll all my real-time footage is 23.976 so you film in 120 and it spits it out as a 30 frames per second clip no matter what you can't change that in the camera at all so there are workarounds you basically just have to select all the 120 frames per second files in your editing program and then you just change its speed to 80 which makes it then 24 frames per second and you're all good but it gets a little tricky and a little wonky when you you know film maybe a ton of clips maybe you have 60 clips some are 24 frames per second some are 60 frames per second then some you film in 120 frames per second which means it's really 30 frames per second clip and you need to go through and kind of match all of those to make it 24 frames especially if you're working in proxies you have to do these steps in the correct order otherwise if you make proxies first and then slow the footage down your proxies won't match up with what the actual footage is and then you go to export your video and the b-roll is just totally different sections of clip that you choose so it's honestly just a huge mess i finally figured out the workflow for it but it is just very particular and it does add a lot of extra steps every time you're trying to record video and trying to kind of just bang out a video quickly alright guys so that is pretty much it those are the big things i think everybody should know before picking up this camera for themself and i really am not trying to steer anyone away from this camera or trying to come off extremely negative but if you're talking about a camera body that's around 4 000 it's spending a ton of money so i think that you should at least have the correct expectations before picking up this camera and maybe if you're considering this camera i hope you found this video helpful again i want to say that this is an amazing camera still for both photo and video honestly it's exceptional at photography and also for the video side of things it's still amazing there's just a couple kind of asterisks and things that you should consider and see if that would kind of hinder your workflow or not but still an incredible all-in-one camera there aren't really a ton of cameras out there especially in this price point that is really good at photography and video on this level at least so it's just all things to consider but guys i would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below if you think the canon r5 if the issues are big enough you want to pick it up for yourself or maybe if you don't really think these things are a big issue and you would still love to have this camera be sure to check out my other canon r5 videos but i think that's gonna be it for me guys i hope you enjoyed watching and you found this video helpful if you did would you please drop this video a thumbs up if you're new around here consider subscribing i really appreciate it it really helps the channel out and i notice each and every single one but guys i'm out for now i will see you in the next video very very soon oh and one little fun fact i'm actually filming on the sony a7s3 today so maybe a video on that here soon too catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] you\",\n",
       " \" [Music] hey there old friend it's been a while yeah 2021 was yeah that was a year you know i did a lot of freelance work a full-time job kept me really busy really busy to the point where youtube was just kind of put on the back burner but i'm here now it is 2022 and today we are talking about the canon eos r5 and if it's still worth it in 2022 short answer is is yes but i i hope you'll still continue watching the rest of this video because i'll tell you the reasons why so kick back relax grab a drink and enjoy the video [Music] so the canon eos r5 is is a workhorse of a camera i've had it for about eight months now i wanted to do a video on this uh six months in didn't get to that but i'm here at eight months so a little bit more time with it to let you guys know what i think of it and i mean ultimately it's i i really really love using this camera it's a joy to use ergonomically it feels fantastic it's very similar to the canon eos r so if you are someone who owns the canon eos r and you upgrade to the r5 ergonomically it's it's pretty similar there are some differences on the back side of the camera which we'll talk about here in a little bit but overall ergonomically fantastic the images that come out of this camera are fantastic the video files out of this are fantastic one downside on the videos is that it can overheat after a little bit of using this and after having it for eight months and using it i can i can say it does overheat it overheated on me uh one time it just makes me really hot yeah well it's a hot issue and i'm getting hot about it too this is good we're all hot at the same time it did overheat on me but i was shooting a lot of 4k 60 and then when it hit that that timer i just jumped over to 1080p 60 and it was fine didn't overheat after that and i just continued using it from there on and that kind of leads me into the next point on this camera is i've been shooting a lot of 1080p on this camera and i know you guys are like what the 1080p out of this camera is actually really pretty damn good it's pretty sharp it's a lot sharper than the the canon eos r so i don't know if they are doing some sort of over sampling or or what have you but really if you put it on a 4k timeline or export the 1080p file as a 4k file i don't think a lot of you are going to notice and the beauty of shooting in 1080p on this camera is first off it doesn't overheat and second you get 10 bit you get 10 bit 422 in 1080p and the 10 bit files out of this camera are an absolute joy to color grade and you can really push and pull the 10 bit file out of this camera in all resolutions really i mean do i wish it didn't overheat yeah bet your sweet peppy i did i definitely understand it overheating an 8k 4k hq a con that i would say is i really wish it didn't overheat in 4k60 that's that's what i really enjoy the 4k 120 again can also understand it overheating but 4k 60 i was i was a little bummed that's call that a con if you will that's one of the first cons of this camera it's very few for me that's definitely one of them and now on to stills which i know everyone is clamoring to hear about on this camera that can shoot 8k video i know you guys are just itching to hear more about stills alright boys prepare to be dazzled but the stills are fantastic out of this camera 45 megapixels uh now the file sizes can be massive but they introduced canon raw c-raw into this camera for stills and it like cuts the file sizes in half and i haven't i haven't seen virtually any difference between just normal raw and c-raw so i just keep it in c-raw and i keep my file sizes cut in half sometimes even a little smaller and that kind of fixes that issue so if anyone out there has the r5 and they're like man ticket stills is just eating up my memory shoot zero you're welcome but really the stills from this camera are fantastic and i'll go ahead and show you a couple examples right now [Music] seriously i am i'm blown away with the stills from this camera 45 megapixels is definitely plenty i thought the canon eos r 30 megapixels was plenty but you know more megapixels i'm not i'm not upset about because when you take the photos and if you want to blow them up into like you know like a movie-sized poster it's gonna look crisp it's gonna look great now when it comes to run and gun for video on this camera it is a near perfect camera as i stated before the overheating is what basically keeps it from being that perfect camera but that doesn't mean you can't capture amazing stuff with it because i have certainly captured some really awesome stuff with it without it overheating for instance i was shooting stills for a local brewery and its anniversary party and i was sitting there thinking i was like why am i not grabbing some video for this so i went ahead and jumped over to video grabbed some video jumped back over stills grab some stills and then i just kept doing that back and forth and the camera lasted didn't overheat at all and this is what i captured [Applause] [Music] now you guys might be surprised to find out that that video has a mix of 4k 60 and 1080p 60. so if you guys can guess which clips are which kudos to you because now even watching it back i forget i forget which clips are which so that again that just goes to show you that the 1080p out of this camera is still really really good and as i stated earlier it just doesn't overheat and how well does the r5 pair with my pocket 4k pretty damn good you know the r5 can actually shoot c log 3. it's a lot flatter than c log so it's easier to match with my pocket 4k i actually have an example i shot the other night so if you guys want to watch it try and guess which shots are the pocket 4k and the r5 go ahead i'll wait and when you're done watching that little clip pause the video go down below type in the comments let me know what do you think what shots are are the pocket 4k and the r5 [Music] [Music] oh hey you're done watching it huh so as i stated yes the r5 pairs really well with the pocket 4k and while i love my pocket 4k i will say reaching for this camera is a lot easier because it's smaller it's lighter the ibis in it is actually pretty fantastic now if you put on a wide angle lens as you guys have seen in other videos the ibis warble is is pretty bad but if you have like a 35 and an up it's pretty damn good so how does it compare to the r as i stated earlier ergonomically it's pretty pretty similar but the uh the back side is where they added a couple things that i'm just just so thrilled that they did and obviously the scroll wheel is back and the joystick is back would i have cared if they didn't put it back in that's what she said probably not because when i had the r i used this corner here right here you can set it to where you can just kind of drag your focus point and it works really really well so and i actually still use that here in the r5 but the one feature i am absolutely thrilled that they brought back was the scroll wheel because it just really helps really helps with just reviewing footage or phone mainly photos scrolling through endless photos and yeah it's it's something that i'm really shocked that they got rid of you know and they put that stupid touch bar on the r i don't you know you live and learn and in this case they learned the hard way no one liked the touch bar it was garbage so how does it compare to the r stills wise the 30 megapixel versus the 45 i don't think you'll notice a big difference but the autofocus in this camera when it comes to stills they've it's fantastic they've added the animal eye uh tracking autofocus and just recently in a new update they've added vehicle tracking which i i played around just just a little bit and yeah it's shocking that it can just pick that up now is the autofocus absolutely perfect no it definitely misses every now and then and there are times where it's it's it misses and it just it's just i don't understand why there's nothing in the surrounding area that would cause it to miss so is it perfect no but it's it's pretty dang good so is it better than the r yes yes it is so if you have the r uh and you want better autofocus go with the r5 now and if the price of the r5 is just way astronomical and too much for you then that's when i would recommend the r6 or god i'm sorry i'm gonna say this but or look at the sony a74 number one how dare you oh god man that hurt i hurt my chest to say but i will say they have gotten better color wise color science looks a lot better and the autofocus from what i've seen is just it might even be a little bit better than canon i think canon has lost the race for the autofocus i think sony is in the lead right now but that that's what i'd recommend if you guys think that the r5 is just way too expensive for you look at the r6 or the sony a74 so what i recommend the canon r5 and 2022 abso freakin literally this camera is just so fun to use and i didn't even mention this i future proof myself with this camera 45 megapixels i'm never gonna need anything more than that the video files out of this camera shooting up to 8k i mean it it can overheat aside from that it can shoot 8k so i have that option if i really really want to i can shoot 8k so i this camera is definitely worth it in 2022. well guys that does it for me on this

       " \" what's going on you guys my name is Jay Fritz and welcome to another video today we're going to be talking about my favorite photo video hybrid camera that's right the Canon R5 should you get it in 2023 or not [Music] so this video is going to be broken down into a few different subjects we're going to talk about my personal experience with this camera we're going to talk about who this camera is intended for the pros and cons of the Canon R5 we're also going to talk about some competitive options that Canon provides for different price ranges and finally we'll answer the question should you buy this camera in 2023 now just so I don't bore you guys to death I'm going to be overlaying a handful of my favorite photos and video clips that I've captured on my Canon R5 over the years speaking of years the first subject we're going to be talking about is my personal experience and how long I've been using this camera I was able to get my hands on the Canon R5 for the first time back in August of 2020. so just about a month after the camera was released so for the last two and a half years I've been able to photograph and film a handful of subjects including everything from Wildlife to weddings to portraits Landscapes and so many more so I've been able to put this camera through the ringer to say the least now I'm not sure if I've mentioned this yet on the channel before but I work full time for the company buck knives I'm there content creator specialist and I work alongside the marketing team so when I was hired for the position one of the first subjects that came to mind was okay what kind of kit do you need what camera do you want what lenses what do you need basically to do your job effectively and the first camera that came to mind was the Canon R5 I've been able to film and photograph fishing trips over in Montana hunting trips in Utah and so many more different local shoots here in Idaho and for every project we've worked on this camera has proven to be the perfect tool for the job I'll share with you guys a handful of the images both from the hunts in Utah and also from some of the Montana fishing trips that I've done honestly I've been super stoked with how this camera's performed both indoors and Outdoors now aside from the work that I've done with buck knives I also have a tremendous amount of experience within the wedding industry I filmed weddings for the last five years and this camera has been a major upgrade to my kit and ensuring that I have a nice hybrid camera to shoot both behind the scenes as well as being the perfect B camera for my Canon C70 having the capabilities of shooting 4K all the way up to 120 frames per second is incred and basically matches what my C70 outputs the primary difference there being that my C70 also has built-in ND filters and so many different video Centric features that make it a much better a camera for most of those bigger projects that I shoot but again as a hybrid shooter if I know I'm going to be working on a project where there's going to be both photo and video deliverables I would feel much more comfortable showing up to the job with something like this Canon R5 If I had to just pick one camera now that you guys have a brief history on what I use this camera for primarily let's jump into some of the pros and cons that I personally have experienced over the last two and a half years so let's start off with some of the pros for those of you guys that don't know too much about the Canon C70 it is a video dedicated camera it cannot take still images it is solely dedicated to video so needless to say I love my C70 but what does that have to do with the R5 the Canon R5's image quality for video is very comparable to the C70 now this isn't a Canon R5 versus Canon C70 video so I'm not going to get into the crazy details between the two cameras but I do bring it up because because it's important to note that this is a hybrid camera that shoots excellent photos and excellent video and if it's comparing to something that is dedicated to video that's in a higher price bracket than the R5 itself that's really impressive and that says a lot about this camera the next topic I want to touch on is just how sharp this camera is I mean it's incredibly detailed it has a 45 megapixel sensor it has the capabilities of shooting 8K video which I personally will never have interest in shooting and I'm never even going to change that setting so it's not even it's kind of Overkill but I'm glad it has the ability and it just goes to show that this camera is a Workhorse as far as image sharpness that's a really really big feature to this camera because for me lately I've been diving a lot more into Wildlife photography and with Wildlife photography two of the most important things are having a sharp clear lens and we're talking about the camera having the ability to crop in on your image without losing too much detail especially if you're intending on printing those images and since we're on the topic of wildlife photography and videography let's jump to my next major Pro and this is honestly probably my personal favorite it is the simply best feature of this camera and it is just how insane the autofocus is with the R5 you tap your subject you let go and you let it work its magic it's insane and it has the ability of tracking so many different subjects whereas something like my C70 again doesn't actually track multiple subjects it does have face tracking but it's limited to only shooting 24 frames per second so if I'm shooting slow motion b-roll I'm not actually able to track my subject I have to just basically tap on a location and just keep my subject in that location on the screen the entire time I'm getting the clip and it becomes a hassle so having such incredible tracking abilities with this camera's autofocus is tremendous it also has animal tracking it will actually lock on to the eye of a flying eagle that is mobbing at stupid speeds which is just crazy and has been super helpful recently when I've actually been getting out and photographing Eagles and that's why I bring that up I highly recommend if you do have this camera if you're looking to get it dive into the menu go through all the settings look into it a little bit because even until recently I didn't even realize just how in-depth the autofocus system gets so let's talk about some of the ergonomics of this camera the Canon R5 has the perfect grip in my opinion I did also pick up the small rig cage to just kind of wrap around the camera give me the ability of mounting my camera on different angles and also attaching additional accessories it is a full firm grip in the hand and honestly it just feels good it's super comfortable the fold out flip out screen is fantastic it's something that I always wanted in my Canon 5D Mark IV and so coming back to a camera that had that ability was so so nice all the buttons are right where I'd want them the only thing that was a little bit weird for me to adjust to was the mode button on the top and just clicking it in and having to hit info every time I wanted to switch from photo to video now I know there are ways to create other shortcuts so that you can do that with your own custom layout but that was one thing that took me a little while to get used to and that was probably the only thing that was like a little difficult to get used to at first with this camera now as much good as I can say about the R5 there are definitely some annoyances and cons to this camera and that's what we're going to get into right now now before I get into this I do want to say I do feel this is a little bit of a personal error because what I've been doing is for a while I was solely shooting on these prograde SD cards which are matched at fairly high speeds so for the most part it performed really well for most of my photo video needs on this camera but I did start to notice that in a couple of my weddings I would be shooting for longer events like the ceremony or the dances and I've had those complete files corrupted where I was not able to retrieve any of the footage from the ceremony and from the dances which is super frustrating to say the least now fortunately I did have my C70 which had no issues at all but a little bit of my confusion came from the fact that I was always shooting on these exact same cards with my Canon C70 and I've been able to shoot on my Canon C70 with 4K 120 for periods of up to 30 minutes and have no issues whatsoever whereas with this camera the R5 I had issues just shooting in 1080 at 24 which seems a little bit odd to me so to solve this problem I upgraded to using compact flash cards and this is all that I used in the R5 now and I have no issues whatsoever it's a little bit of a pricey upgrade but honestly it allows you to shoot everything all the way up to 4K 120 so I can't complain it enables me to do the job and I should have been using these in the first place that was my fault one other issue that I've had was while using my Canon EF Mount lenses adapted to the R5 specifically my 85 millimeter F 1.2 lens there were a handful of occasion early on when using that lens mounted to this camera where the camera just didn't identify the fact that there was a lens on the camera it was really frustrating because it messed up my settings maybe a more recent firmware update solved that issue because when I used my big lens for wildlife I have not noticed any issues whatsoever so again I think it's been fixed for the most part but it was something that did occur so I figured I'd mention it now the elephant in the room the subject of matter that everyone's talked about non-stop since this camera came out which is overheating yes it's an issue it's not nearly as much of an issue now as it was when the camera first came out back in 2020 because when it did first get released I had so many issues even shooting just in regular 1080 HD for long periods of time and that was super frustrating even shooting photos in a controlled environment with AC in the room in Arizona I still had issues with the camera overheating again just from Stills however there was a recent firmware update that pretty much got rid of most all overheating within the camera which is really interesting and makes you question whether that was just a selling point for the Canon r5c and the C70 and every other camera released after the R5 but with all that said this camera now functions almost flawlessly it still will get a little bit hot if you're shooting extended periods of high resolution like 4K at you know higher frame rates like 60 or 120 but for the most part it doesn't have any issues nowadays now it definitely gets a little bit of an edge with having such a large sensor and 45 megapixels that gives you a lot of detail in your images so cleaning up some of the noise is fairly easy but overall for its price range compared to some options that maybe Sony provides it definitely isn't as good in low light again not a big issue I still shoot some pretty crazy low light situations with this lens and this camera and still get great results as long as I'm doing proper post processing specifically by using denoising tools like what topaz provides and honestly after using post processing tools like that you won't notice that much of a difference at all alright guys so now you know some of the pros and cons you know my personal opinions on this camera I absolutely love everything about it but does that mean that you should buy this camera well I don't know it depends what is your budget now the reason I bring that up is because ever since the R5 was released there have been a handful of other options that Canon has dropped that are great depending on what your price range is first thing that comes to mind is the little brother of the R5 which is the Canon R6 the only real main difference between the Canon R6 and specifically the Canon R6 Mark II and the R5 is that you just get less megapixels and that's pretty much it you get almost the same performance in both photo and video between the two cameras except for I'm not sure if the Canon R6 provides 4K at 120. so the Canon R6 comes in a price range of right around 2 400 and I believe the R6 Mark II runs it right around 2500 if I'm not mistaken the Canon R5 on the other hand comes in at around 3 900 and after tax that's pushes you over the four thousand dollar Mark so it's definitely a pricey option and again that's why it's really important to consider some of these other Alternatives especially if you're doing something that's more for hobby maybe you're not doing full-time photography or videography you're just looking for something that is really solid gives you great quality but doesn't force you to sell your car to get a camera so you know now if the R6 price range of 24 to 2500 is still a little bit pricey for you there's great news Canon also recently released the r10 and the R7 the R7 specifically runs at a price range of around fifteen hundred dollars and is still considered to be you know kind of an entry-level professional camera as well which is super cool for 1500 bucks the main difference between something like the R6 and the R7 is that the R7 is a crop sensor camera whereas the R6 is still full frame like the R5 but for 1500 bucks to get a camera that is also capable of 4K up to 60 frames per second is insane and I like I wish that camera existed like four years ago so there are definitely some more affordable options if you're not willing to drop four thousand dollars on something like the Canon R5 which is great ultimately what it's going to come down to is are you will willing to spend the four thousand dollars it's going to take to get this camera or is it smarter to go with something like the R6 Mark II and spend that extra fifteen hundred dollars on additional accessories or like a better lens or something which honestly could be the better option depending on where you're at in your career but for full-time professionals the investment is absolutely worth it with the R5 the other thing I would suggest is potentially keeping your eye on the market because it looks like this year in 2023 we may have some other additions to the Canon r5 family and what I mean by the r5 family is the R5 the r5c and potentially what has been rumored which is the r5s which would be a photo Centric version of the R5 where you'd get up to potentially 100 megapixels in your sensor which is nuts but what that means is that a lot of people may be interested in selling their r5s and getting the r5s so if you're someone that's in the market for something like the R5 you don't want to spend the full four thousand dollars on a brand new body and you're interested in looking for something used maybe wait a little bit longer and you might just find some decent deals on the market well guys I think that's pretty much going to wrap up today's video on the Canon R5 ultimately my last thoughts on this camera is I absolutely love it it has been a dream to own this camera it pairs so beautifully with my Canon C70 and this is honestly the best matchup and Duo I can personally Envision until they drop the R1 so if you guys do end up deciding that you're interested in

       " 'text': \" what's up everybody peter mckinnon here welcome back to yet another video and folks today we're talking about the canon r5 [Music] the highly anticipated much discussed rumored all the buzz and for a very good reason because this camera delivers i couldn't be more excited about it now before we dive into this thing and i talk about my experience and show you some footage because i have been shooting with it for a few months now canon sent me this camera on loan i'm giving it back actually in a few hours to test out basically in the middle of the pandemic but i want you to know too right at the beginning i'm sponsored by canon i'm an ambassador for the brand i'm a canon shooter i've been a canon shooter my entire life i've been shooting canon since i bought my first professional dslr that's about 15 years now i've been using canon products so keep that in mind when i'm doing this review i'm not going to be unfair about it if there are things i don't like about it i'm going to tell you but luckily for this camera it is exceptional and there's not a whole lot of things that i don't like about it so you're excited i'm excited let's talk about one of the biggest camera releases of the year of the is it of the decade could we say decade it's one of the biggest releases for canon for sure this is back to the 5d mark ii days let's talk about those days for a second hands up who remembers a filmmaker by the name of vincent laforay amazing made a film called reverie back in i'm gonna say it was like november 2008 with the 5d mark ii now this was one of the first times we'd seen cinematic looking footage with depth of field shot on a dslr that was a big deal then you had heavy hitters like philip bloom coming out with incredible courses on how to use a dslr as like a filmmaking camera in the right settings and the accessories and that will always be a staple in my mind learning from him when i was much younger that was a big deal for canon that was a huge camera release the 5d mark ii the r5 i feel and i think a lot of people would agree with me the r5 is that big deal of a release now for canon let's talk about why this camera is important why people are talking about it where all the buzz is coming from let me show you how this thing works there's the top down angle you've got your flip out screen that we've all come to love the body's a little bit thicker than the eos r not by a whole lot but that's obviously accounting for the new in body image stabilization the wheel is back the joystick is back the functionality that a lot of us are used to coming from the dslr side of things it makes it faster easier to use it just feels right here's something that'll make a lot of people happy dual card slots you've got a spot for a cf express which is the new type of like high-speed car that this thing's taking and then you have an sd card slot it takes the same lp e6 batteries that we've all have like 100 of so that is a massive benefit now there are new ones they've got this little sticker on them that's kind of how you're able to differentiate the new ones from the old ones and apparently it's just the software and the cameras is able to use this battery to just distribute the power in a more efficient way it's not necessarily that the battery's bigger and giving you more battery life but the camera and the software now is smarter and it's using these batteries better than the old ones same chargers that's good all right so taking a look at the difference in comparison of size to the r5 and the r here they are with the back button layout like i said this bar is gone you get your joystick here instead of your directional kind of d-pad sort of control you've got the wheel and other than that they look pretty much the same this r5 is just a little bit thicker so if we look at them both side by side a little bit fatter grip's a little bit bigger we flip them over on the sides this side right here is a really good representation of how much thicker it is most of everything in the same place another top down honestly in my opinion it feels better ergonomically so now you've got ibis in the body you've got image stabilization in the lens those two things working together to get you some super stable footage something people have wanted for a long time it's one of those instances where you're reading the stats online and you're like this can't be true is this right does this do 8k raw c-log with autofocus 4k 120 yep i mean when we're even looking at all the modes on this camera as far as how they're represented within the menu canon's menus have always been good but the ui within how to get to different frame rates and resolutions has been improved even more now they've just broken it down into three menu options basically it's very clearly broken down here which makes it a breeze to just go boop boop boop and you know exactly what you're setting now to get that high frame rate you're still going to go over to the other menu hit high frame rate enable that's going to go into 4k 120. photographers 45 megapixels right i've been shooting on 20 megapixels with the 1dx mark ii for like a good quarter plus of my entire career so 45 megapixels that's great that's some high-res stuff right there one of the things i love i love the shutter sound and click of this camera that's a big thing if it's just like a nasty shutter sound and click can't do it this that's subtle check this out shutter mode electronic listen to this everybody just shot like 15 frames there's so many times in photography where that shutter sound can actually be an issue wildlife photography for example if you're someone that's camping out and you're waiting for a hummingbird or you're waiting for an animal gone with this you're not even sure if you shot the frame it's so silent so that is amazing you're shooting live events weddings any type of thing where people are talking and the focus is not on you it's on something else and you're needing to photograph that without being a distraction amazing frames per second wise this thing is fast you're going to get 12 frames per second mechanical you're going to get 20 frames per second when you're in live view so it rips in live view mode one two three see the border right there see that white frame just freaking out that's how fast it's shooting that was a hundred and thirty photos i just snapped you heard nothing that's got to be one of my favorite new features because i used that on the 1dx mark iii constantly you're dropping something in a tank of water you're shooting john hill do a fakie 360 flip nose grind into a kickflip manual and shove it out switch you want to capture these moments without having to worry about like did i get it in frame 20 frames per second if you didn't get it in frame there's a whole different issue so let's talk about my experience using this r5 since pete you've clearly had it for quite some time now tell me what it's like i know the specs i see them i've read them all those things how is the camera dude how is it i'll start by saying i got this camera like in the thick of the lockdown i didn't get a chance to use it as much as i wanted to because parks were closed trails were closed no one was going outside so a lot of the use that i got from the r5 at the beginning for like the bulk of the time that i had it in my possession was stuff at home photographing the pets photographing the kids doing things like that around the house things that you do when you first get a camera at home and you open the box and you're like uh come here boy it felt so good to shoot 120 frames per second again used it all the time on the 1dx mark ii got used to shooting 60p on the eos r but it was really good to shoot in 120 again and remember how good it looks and how good it looks in 4k insane now the version i have is a prototype version it's not a finished production version that's why it has the words sample on it and this is the one i've had for a few months so there were some quirks and things to it that i think will be ironed out when the launch version comes and there was also a couple things that i was unsure of example if you're shooting a lot of 4k 120 sometimes the camera starts to overheat and gives you that overheat warning just so that the things inside don't melt and it doesn't get destroyed when you think of a cinema series camera like the c500 and up those all have huge fans built into them but we're talking a mirrorless camera here this is this is very small this little thing doesn't have two giant fans cooling it down the entire time so it gets hot of course the more shooting that you do you're gonna have to wait so it makes sense to me that it overheats based off those settings that you're shooting at for me though that is one of the downsides i understand having to wait for the camera to cool down i don't want to wait i just want to keep shooting i don't think there's there's x if you shoot this much you have to wait this long because it's all situational it's gonna depend on different conditions are you shooting in the jungle where it's super hot and humid and all you're doing is 8k and 4k 120 are you shooting in the arctic where it's the complete opposite are you not shooting much 4k 120 maybe just a few clips here and there you're never going to have an issue so it all depends on the project the place the conditions it's entirely situational but it is one of those things that you're gonna have to keep in mind when you're shooting just in case i don't think it'll be anything drastic or anything to really worry about it just makes sense to protect the camera from the inside so the whole thing doesn't melt because let's be honest this tiny little package right here is shooting 8k raw which is incredible for a little mirrorless camera magic it looks like we're shooting on a cinema camera it looks that good so we were just incredibly impressed and inspired having that kind of quality in a tiny body like this plus getting that dual pixel auto focus being able to do all of those types of things that we typically want to shoot without having to worry about pulling focus like you do on a cinema camera being able to have that 8k feature that 4k 120 in log mode while still taking advantage of the dual pixel autofocus system that's that is huge that's massive that opens up so many doors you basically don't even need a gimbal when you're using this camera obviously gimbals have their place depending on the types of moves and types of shots you want to do but for the most part i always try to get away without having to use one without having to bring one an extreme example of that is a few weeks ago i was hanging out the side of a razor side by side with the pro driver up north he was going like 130 140 down this crazy dirt road and drifting corners and i was just hand holding this with one hand because the other was holding on for life and i was trying to vlog that whole thing with the ibis with the image stabilization i mean it looks fantastic and that's not even in slow motion i i don't see the need to even bring a gimbal when you travel or any of those things it's it's just so good let's talk about the price you're looking at for the body only 52.99 now that's canadian dollars that's important to say if you're watching this anywhere else do the math look it up that is a good price to get a camera that packs as much punch as a cinema camera in a lot of instances in a package this small think about travel think about portability you can take this anywhere this flies under the radar this doesn't look like you're shooting professional looking 8k raw footage you get a big cinema camera you go in somewhere sorry that can't whatever you guys are doing in here it's not allowed it's a school project no it's not a school project this is going to get into those places this thing is portable it's small it's inconspicuous a camera that's over five thousand dollars is not a cheap camera by any means that's a lot of money given that i think it's warranted based off what you're getting inside this if that's out of your wheelhouse don't be worried there's another option for you that's the new r6 camera now if you want to learn more about this and the cost and all the features and things compared to the r5 you can watch this video right here so the fact now that i can shoot a vlog in 4k at 10 bit 422 internal the amount of information that this camera is recording it looks like i'm editing cinema camera footage that's because this camera packs so much inside so i've had people ask like will you be switching to the r5 and yes i'll be switching to this camera this will be my new main driver daily driver travel camera if i'm vlogging if i'm making short films i'm gonna be shooting them on this because it packs so much in such a small footprint and there's so many things in here that i've been waiting for in a camera for years well done guys seriously well done all right guys so that is it for me that's your first look at the canon eos r5 from someone that's been using it for a few weeks and had hands on for a few months now i hope you got something out of that i hope that was a good representation of the camera you got to see some of the specs you get to see some of the footage used what it looks like what it looks like uploaded to youtube after it's been compressed all of those things i hope it was helpful and i hope mostly that you enjoyed it so thanks for sticking around i appreciate you watching and thanks to canon for sending me those cameras early i had a blast i'll see you guys in the next one peace when you hear the word artist you might think of a painter a museum fancy degree when i hear the word artist i think of my friends the local restaurant owner a little kid sitting under a blanket with a flashlight dreaming of the stars [Music] you\",\n",

      "cc [\" what's up everybody peter mckinnon here welcome back to yet another video and folks today we're talking about the canon r5 [Music] the highly anticipated much discussed rumored all the buzz and for a very good reason because this camera delivers i couldn't be more excited about it now before we dive into this thing and i talk about my experience and show you some footage because i have been shooting with it for a few months now canon sent me this camera on loan i'm giving it back actually in a few hours to test out basically in the middle of the pandemic but i want you to know too right at the beginning i'm sponsored by canon i'm an ambassador for the brand i'm a canon shooter i've been a canon shooter my entire life i've been shooting canon since i bought my first professional dslr that's about 15 years now i've been using canon products so keep that in mind when i'm doing this review i'm not going to be unfair about it if there are things i don't like about it i'm going to tell you but luckily for this camera it is exceptional and there's not a whole lot of things that i don't like about it so you're excited i'm excited let's talk about one of the biggest camera releases of the year of the is it of the decade could we say decade it's one of the biggest releases for canon for sure this is back to the 5d mark ii days let's talk about those days for a second hands up who remembers a filmmaker by the name of vincent laforay amazing made a film called reverie back in i'm gonna say it was like november 2008 with the 5d mark ii now this was one of the first times we'd seen cinematic looking footage with depth of field shot on a dslr that was a big deal then you had heavy hitters like philip bloom coming out with incredible courses on how to use a dslr as like a filmmaking camera in the right settings and the accessories and that will always be a staple in my mind learning from him when i was much younger that was a big deal for canon that was a huge camera release the 5d mark ii the r5 i feel and i think a lot of people would agree with me the r5 is that big deal of a release now for canon let's talk about why this camera is important why people are talking about it where all the buzz is coming from let me show you how this thing works there's the top down angle you've got your flip out screen that we've all come to love the body's a little bit thicker than the eos r not by a whole lot but that's obviously accounting for the new in body image stabilization the wheel is back the joystick is back the functionality that a lot of us are used to coming from the dslr side of things it makes it faster easier to use it just feels right here's something that'll make a lot of people happy dual card slots you've got a spot for a cf express which is the new type of like high-speed car that this thing's taking and then you have an sd card slot it takes the same lp e6 batteries that we've all have like 100 of so that is a massive benefit now there are new ones they've got this little sticker on them that's kind of how you're able to differentiate the new ones from the old ones and apparently it's just the software and the cameras is able to use this battery to just distribute the power in a more efficient way it's not necessarily that the battery's bigger and giving you more battery life but the camera and the software now is smarter and it's using these batteries better than the old ones same chargers that's good all right so taking a look at the difference in comparison of size to the r5 and the r here they are with the back button layout like i said this bar is gone you get your joystick here instead of your directional kind of d-pad sort of control you've got the wheel and other than that they look pretty much the same this r5 is just a little bit thicker so if we look at them both side by side a little bit fatter grip's a little bit bigger we flip them over on the sides this side right here is a really good representation of how much thicker it is most of everything in the same place another top down honestly in my opinion it feels better ergonomically so now you've got ibis in the body you've got image stabilization in the lens those two things working together to get you some super stable footage something people have wanted for a long time it's one of those instances where you're reading the stats online and you're like this can't be true is this right does this do 8k raw c-log with autofocus 4k 120 yep i mean when we're even looking at all the modes on this camera as far as how they're represented within the menu canon's menus have always been good but the ui within how to get to different frame rates and resolutions has been improved even more now they've just broken it down into three menu options basically it's very clearly broken down here which makes it a breeze to just go boop boop boop and you know exactly what you're setting now to get that high frame rate you're still going to go over to the other menu hit high frame rate enable that's going to go into 4k 120. photographers 45 megapixels right i've been shooting on 20 megapixels with the 1dx mark ii for like a good quarter plus of my entire career so 45 megapixels that's great that's some high-res stuff right there one of the things i love i love the shutter sound and click of this camera that's a big thing if it's just like a nasty shutter sound and click can't do it this that's subtle check this out shutter mode electronic listen to this everybody just shot like 15 frames there's so many times in photography where that shutter sound can actually be an issue wildlife photography for example if you're someone that's camping out and you're waiting for a hummingbird or you're waiting for an animal gone with this you're not even sure if you shot the frame it's so silent so that is amazing you're shooting live events weddings any type of thing where people are talking and the focus is not on you it's on something else and you're needing to photograph that without being a distraction amazing frames per second wise this thing is fast you're going to get 12 frames per second mechanical you're going to get 20 frames per second when you're in live view so it rips in live view mode one two three see the border right there see that white frame just freaking out that's how fast it's shooting that was a hundred and thirty photos i just snapped you heard nothing that's got to be one of my favorite new features because i used that on the 1dx mark iii constantly you're dropping something in a tank of water you're shooting john hill do a fakie 360 flip nose grind into a kickflip manual and shove it out switch you want to capture these moments without having to worry about like did i get it in frame 20 frames per second if you didn't get it in frame there's a whole different issue so let's talk about my experience using this r5 since pete you've clearly had it for quite some time now tell me what it's like i know the specs i see them i've read them all those things how is the camera dude how is it i'll start by saying i got this camera like in the thick of the lockdown i didn't get a chance to use it as much as i wanted to because parks were closed trails were closed no one was going outside so a lot of the use that i got from the r5 at the beginning for like the bulk of the time that i had it in my possession was stuff at home photographing the pets photographing the kids doing things like that around the house things that you do when you first get a camera at home and you open the box and you're like uh come here boy it felt so good to shoot 120 frames per second again used it all the time on the 1dx mark ii got used to shooting 60p on the eos r but it was really good to shoot in 120 again and remember how good it looks and how good it looks in 4k insane now the version i have is a prototype version it's not a finished production version that's why it has the words sample on it and this is the one i've had for a few months so there were some quirks and things to it that i think will be ironed out when the launch version comes and there was also a couple things that i was unsure of example if you're shooting a lot of 4k 120 sometimes the camera starts to overheat and gives you that overheat warning just so that the things inside don't melt and it doesn't get destroyed when you think of a cinema series camera like the c500 and up those all have huge fans built into them but we're talking a mirrorless camera here this is this is very small this little thing doesn't have two giant fans cooling it down the entire time so it gets hot of course the more shooting that you do you're gonna have to wait so it makes sense to me that it overheats based off those settings that you're shooting at for me though that is one of the downsides i understand having to wait for the camera to cool down i don't want to wait i just want to keep shooting i don't think there's there's x if you shoot this much you have to wait this long because it's all situational it's gonna depend on different conditions are you shooting in the jungle where it's super hot and humid and all you're doing is 8k and 4k 120 are you shooting in the arctic where it's the complete opposite are you not shooting much 4k 120 maybe just a few clips here and there you're never going to have an issue so it all depends on the project the place the conditions it's entirely situational but it is one of those things that you're gonna have to keep in mind when you're shooting just in case i don't think it'll be anything drastic or anything to really worry about it just makes sense to protect the camera from the inside so the whole thing doesn't melt because let's be honest this tiny little package right here is shooting 8k raw which is incredible for a little mirrorless camera magic it looks like we're shooting on a cinema camera it looks that good so we were just incredibly impressed and inspired having that kind of quality in a tiny body like this plus getting that dual pixel auto focus being able to do all of those types of things that we typically want to shoot without having to worry about pulling focus like you do on a cinema camera being able to have that 8k feature that 4k 120 in log mode while still taking advantage of the dual pixel autofocus system that's that is huge that's massive that opens up so many doors you basically don't even need a gimbal when you're using this camera obviously gimbals have their place depending on the types of moves and types of shots you want to do but for the most part i always try to get away without having to use one without having to bring one an extreme example of that is a few weeks ago i was hanging out the side of a razor side by side with the pro driver up north he was going like 130 140 down this crazy dirt road and drifting corners and i was just hand holding this with one hand because the other was holding on for life and i was trying to vlog that whole thing with the ibis with the image stabilization i mean it looks fantastic and that's not even in slow motion i i don't see the need to even bring a gimbal when you travel or any of those things it's it's just so good let's talk about the price you're looking at for the body only 52.99 now that's canadian dollars that's important to say if you're watching this anywhere else do the math look it up that is a good price to get a camera that packs as much punch as a cinema camera in a lot of instances in a package this small think about travel think about portability you can take this anywhere this flies under the radar this doesn't look like you're shooting professional looking 8k raw footage you get a big cinema camera you go in somewhere sorry that can't whatever you guys are doing in here it's not allowed it's a school project no it's not a school project this is going to get into those places this thing is portable it's small it's inconspicuous a camera that's over five thousand dollars is not a cheap camera by any means that's a lot of money given that i think it's warranted based off what you're getting inside this if that's out of your wheelhouse don't be worried there's another option for you that's the new r6 camera now if you want to learn more about this and the cost and all the features and things compared to the r5 you can watch this video right here so the fact now that i can shoot a vlog in 4k at 10 bit 422 internal the amount of information that this camera is recording it looks like i'm editing cinema camera footage that's because this camera packs so much inside so i've had people ask like will you be switching to the r5 and yes i'll be switching to this camera this will be my new main driver daily driver travel camera if i'm vlogging if i'm making short films i'm gonna be shooting them on this because it packs so much in such a small footprint and there's so many things in here that i've been waiting for in a camera for years well done guys seriously well done all right guys so that is it for me that's your first look at the canon eos r5 from someone that's been using it for a few weeks and had hands on for a few months now i hope you got something out of that i hope that was a good representation of the camera you got to see some of the specs you get to see some of the footage used what it looks like what it looks like uploaded to youtube after it's been compressed all of those things i hope it was helpful and i hope mostly that you enjoyed it so thanks for sticking around i appreciate you watching and thanks to canon for sending me those cameras early i had a blast i'll see you guys in the next one peace when you hear the word artist you might think of a painter a museum fancy degree when i hear the word artist i think of my friends the local restaurant owner a little kid sitting under a blanket with a flashlight dreaming of the stars [Music] you\", \" what's going on you guys my name is Jay Fritz and welcome to another video today we're going to be talking about my favorite photo video hybrid camera that's right the Canon R5 should you get it in 2023 or not [Music] so this video is going to be broken down into a few different subjects we're going to talk about my personal experience with this camera we're going to talk about who this camera is intended for the pros and cons of the Canon R5 we're also going to talk about some competitive options that Canon provides for different price ranges and finally we'll answer the question should you buy this camera in 2023 now just so I don't bore you guys to death I'm going to be overlaying a handful of my favorite photos and video clips that I've captured on my Canon R5 over the years speaking of years the first subject we're going to be talking about is my personal experience and how long I've been using this camera I was able to get my hands on the Canon R5 for the first time back in August of 2020. so just about a month after the camera was released so for the last two and a half years I've been able to photograph and film a handful of subjects including everything from Wildlife to weddings to portraits Landscapes and so many more so I've been able to put this camera through the ringer to say the least now I'm not sure if I've mentioned this yet on the channel before but I work full time for the company buck knives I'm there content creator specialist and I work alongside the marketing team so when I was hired for the position one of the first subjects that came to mind was okay what kind of kit do you need what camera do you want what lenses what do you need basically to do your job effectively and the first camera that came to mind was the Canon R5 I've been able to film and photograph fishing trips over in Montana hunting trips in Utah and so many more different local shoots here in Idaho and for every project we've worked on this camera has proven to be the perfect tool for the job I'll share with you guys a handful of the images both from the hunts in Utah and also from some of the Montana fishing trips that I've done honestly I've been super stoked with how this camera's performed both indoors and Outdoors now aside from the work that I've done with buck knives I also have a tremendous amount of experience within the wedding industry I filmed weddings for the last five years and this camera has been a major upgrade to my kit and ensuring that I have a nice hybrid camera to shoot both behind the scenes as well as being the perfect B camera for my Canon C70 having the capabilities of shooting 4K all the way up to 120 frames per second is incred and basically matches what my C70 outputs the primary difference there being that my C70 also has built-in ND filters and so many different video Centric features that make it a much better a camera for most of those bigger projects that I shoot but again as a hybrid shooter if I know I'm going to be working on a project where there's going to be both photo and video deliverables I would feel much more comfortable showing up to the job with something like this Canon R5 If I had to just pick one camera now that you guys have a brief history on what I use this camera for primarily let's jump into some of the pros and cons that I personally have experienced over the last two and a half years so let's start off with some of the pros for those of you guys that don't know too much about the Canon C70 it is a video dedicated camera it cannot take still images it is solely dedicated to video so needless to say I love my C70 but what does that have to do with the R5 the Canon R5's image quality for video is very comparable to the C70 now this isn't a Canon R5 versus Canon C70 video so I'm not going to get into the crazy details between the two cameras but I do bring it up because because it's important to note that this is a hybrid camera that shoots excellent photos and excellent video and if it's comparing to something that is dedicated to video that's in a higher price bracket than the R5 itself that's really impressive and that says a lot about this camera the next topic I want to touch on is just how sharp this camera is I mean it's incredibly detailed it has a 45 megapixel sensor it has the capabilities of shooting 8K video which I personally will never have interest in shooting and I'm never even going to change that setting so it's not even it's kind of Overkill but I'm glad it has the ability and it just goes to show that this camera is a Workhorse as far as image sharpness that's a really really big feature to this camera because for me lately I've been diving a lot more into Wildlife photography and with Wildlife photography two of the most important things are having a sharp clear lens and we're talking about the camera having the ability to crop in on your image without losing too much detail especially if you're intending on printing those images and since we're on the topic of wildlife photography and videography let's jump to my next major Pro and this is honestly probably my personal favorite it is the simply best feature of this camera and it is just how insane the autofocus is with the R5 you tap your subject you let go and you let it work its magic it's insane and it has the ability of tracking so many different subjects whereas something like my C70 again doesn't actually track multiple subjects it does have face tracking but it's limited to only shooting 24 frames per second so if I'm shooting slow motion b-roll I'm not actually able to track my subject I have to just basically tap on a location and just keep my subject in that location on the screen the entire time I'm getting the clip and it becomes a hassle so having such incredible tracking abilities with this camera's autofocus is tremendous it also has animal tracking it will actually lock on to the eye of a flying eagle that is mobbing at stupid speeds which is just crazy and has been super helpful recently when I've actually been getting out and photographing Eagles and that's why I bring that up I highly recommend if you do have this camera if you're looking to get it dive into the menu go through all the settings look into it a little bit because even until recently I didn't even realize just how in-depth the autofocus system gets so let's talk about some of the ergonomics of this camera the Canon R5 has the perfect grip in my opinion I did also pick up the small rig cage to just kind of wrap around the camera give me the ability of mounting my camera on different angles and also attaching additional accessories it is a full firm grip in the hand and honestly it just feels good it's super comfortable the fold out flip out screen is fantastic it's something that I always wanted in my Canon 5D Mark IV and so coming back to a camera that had that ability was so so nice all the buttons are right where I'd want them the only thing that was a little bit weird for me to adjust to was the mode button on the top and just clicking it in and having to hit info every time I wanted to switch from photo to video now I know there are ways to create other shortcuts so that you can do that with your own custom layout but that was one thing that took me a little while to get used to and that was probably the only thing that was like a little difficult to get used to at first with this camera now as much good as I can say about the R5 there are definitely some annoyances and cons to this camera and that's what we're going to get into right now now before I get into this I do want to say I do feel this is a little bit of a personal error because what I've been doing is for a while I was solely shooting on these prograde SD cards which are matched at fairly high speeds so for the most part it performed really well for most of my photo video needs on this camera but I did start to notice that in a couple of my weddings I would be shooting for longer events like the ceremony or the dances and I've had those complete files corrupted where I was not able to retrieve any of the footage from the ceremony and from the dances which is super frustrating to say the least now fortunately I did have my C70 which had no issues at all but a little bit of my confusion came from the fact that I was always shooting on these exact same cards with my Canon C70 and I've been able to shoot on my Canon C70 with 4K 120 for periods of up to 30 minutes and have no issues whatsoever whereas with this camera the R5 I had issues just shooting in 1080 at 24 which seems a little bit odd to me so to solve this problem I upgraded to using compact flash cards and this is all that I used in the R5 now and I have no issues whatsoever it's a little bit of a pricey upgrade but honestly it allows you to shoot everything all the way up to 4K 120 so I can't complain it enables me to do the job and I should have been using these in the first place that was my fault one other issue that I've had was while using my Canon EF Mount lenses adapted to the R5 specifically my 85 millimeter F 1.2 lens there were a handful of occasion early on when using that lens mounted to this camera where the camera just didn't identify the fact that there was a lens on the camera it was really frustrating because it messed up my settings maybe a more recent firmware update solved that issue because when I used my big lens for wildlife I have not noticed any issues whatsoever so again I think it's been fixed for the most part but it was something that did occur so I figured I'd mention it now the elephant in the room the subject of matter that everyone's talked about non-stop since this camera came out which is overheating yes it's an issue it's not nearly as much of an issue now as it was when the camera first came out back in 2020 because when it did first get released I had so many issues even shooting just in regular 1080 HD for long periods of time and that was super frustrating even shooting photos in a controlled environment with AC in the room in Arizona I still had issues with the camera overheating again just from Stills however there was a recent firmware update that pretty much got rid of most all overheating within the camera which is really interesting and makes you question whether that was just a selling point for the Canon r5c and the C70 and every other camera released after the R5 but with all that said this camera now functions almost flawlessly it still will get a little bit hot if you're shooting extended periods of high resolution like 4K at you know higher frame rates like 60 or 120 but for the most part it doesn't have any issues nowadays now it definitely gets a little bit of an edge with having such a large sensor and 45 megapixels that gives you a lot of detail in your images so cleaning up some of the noise is fairly easy but overall for its price range compared to some options that maybe Sony provides it definitely isn't as good in low light again not a big issue I still shoot some pretty crazy low light situations with this lens and this camera and still get great results as long as I'm doing proper post processing specifically by using denoising tools like what topaz provides and honestly after using post processing tools like that you won't notice that much of a difference at all alright guys so now you know some of the pros and cons you know my personal opinions on this camera I absolutely love everything about it but does that mean that you should buy this camera well I don't know it depends what is your budget now the reason I bring that up is because ever since the R5 was released there have been a handful of other options that Canon has dropped that are great depending on what your price range is first thing that comes to mind is the little brother of the R5 which is the Canon R6 the only real main difference between the Canon R6 and specifically the Canon R6 Mark II and the R5 is that you just get less megapixels and that's pretty much it you get almost the same performance in both photo and video between the two cameras except for I'm not sure if the Canon R6 provides 4K at 120. so the Canon R6 comes in a price range of right around 2 400 and I believe the R6 Mark II runs it right around 2500 if I'm not mistaken the Canon R5 on the other hand comes in at around 3 900 and after tax that's pushes you over the four thousand dollar Mark so it's definitely a pricey option and again that's why it's really important to consider some of these other Alternatives especially if you're doing something that's more for hobby maybe you're not doing full-time photography or videography you're just looking for something that is really solid gives you great quality but doesn't force you to sell your car to get a camera so you know now if the R6 price range of 24 to 2500 is still a little bit pricey for you there's great news Canon also recently released the r10 and the R7 the R7 specifically runs at a price range of around fifteen hundred dollars and is still considered to be you know kind of an entry-level professional camera as well which is super cool for 1500 bucks the main difference between something like the R6 and the R7 is that the R7 is a crop sensor camera whereas the R6 is still full frame like the R5 but for 1500 bucks to get a camera that is also capable of 4K up to 60 frames per second is insane and I like I wish that camera existed like four years ago so there are definitely some more affordable options if you're not willing to drop four thousand dollars on something like the Canon R5 which is great ultimately what it's going to come down to is are you will willing to spend the four thousand dollars it's going to take to get this camera or is it smarter to go with something like the R6 Mark II and spend that extra fifteen hundred dollars on additional accessories or like a better lens or something which honestly could be the better option depending on where you're at in your career but for full-time professionals the investment is absolutely worth it with the R5 the other thing I would suggest is potentially keeping your eye on the market because it looks like this year in 2023 we may have some other additions to the Canon r5 family and what I mean by the r5 family is the R5 the r5c and potentially what has been rumored which is the r5s which would be a photo Centric version of the R5 where you'd get up to potentially 100 megapixels in your sensor which is nuts but what that means is that a lot of people may be interested in selling their r5s and getting the r5s so if you're someone that's in the market for something like the R5 you don't want to spend the full four thousand dollars on a brand new body and you're interested in looking for something used maybe wait a little bit longer and you might just find some decent deals on the market well guys I think that's pretty much going to wrap up today's video on the Canon R5 ultimately my last thoughts on this camera is I absolutely love it it has been a dream to own this camera it pairs so beautifully with my Canon C70 and this is honestly the best matchup and Duo I can personally Envision until they drop the R1

helps me out so I really appreciate it thanks so much for watching this video and we'll see you in the next one [Music]\", \" what's going on guys in today's video we're going to be talking about the canon r5 more specifically i want to talk about some things that i wish i knew about this camera before i purchased it now i've had this camera now for about eight or nine months i actually picked it up on launch day so i've been using this thing for both photo and video for almost a year now so i definitely have some strong thoughts on it now i don't think there's any question that this is one of the best cameras out there on the market right now it's definitely marketed as kind of an all-in-one it's exceptional at both photo and video and i would agree with that especially on the photo side of things i honestly don't have any complaints but being somebody who does a ton of video work especially here with my youtube channel there are some things that i definitely wish i knew about it before i decided to purchase it or maybe some things that you should at least consider before you buy this camera for yourself now the first thing that i wish i knew about the canon r5 before i got it for myself was the ibis wobble now in case you don't know what ibis wobble is or ibis itself ibis stands for in body image stabilization which basically means the sensor in this camera body is floating which what that allows you to do is when you are holding your camera handheld it takes out some of that natural handshake because the sensor doesn't feel every little jitter which is actually amazing for photography especially if you're shooting on longer lenses but the drawback of it when the ibis is so strong like it is in the canon r5 is you get this weird warping effect whenever you're filming at a really wide angle now i'll insert a clip or two in here so you guys can see exactly what i'm talking about if maybe you aren't familiar with this all right so i have the ibis turned on with the image stabilization on this lens now you guys tell me like i said some people out there are saying that this is no longer an issue it definitely happens when you kind of have to go back and forth real quick but that happens when you're filming so it's an issue in my opinion and you guys uh be the judge let me know in the comments below do you still see it because uh i sure do and i think it looks absolutely disgusting like i would not feel comfortable even using a clip with this warping effect on my youtube channel let alone with professional works or with clients at all now currently canon doesn't allow you to turn ibis off in the camera i pray that someday they add a firmware update where you can just turn it on and off in the camera but as of now you can't so there's only one way to do it so if you have one of these newer lenses from canon like i do the 15 to 35 it's actually an image stabilized lens so the only way to turn off ibis in the camera body on the r5 is if you have an image stabilized lens you turn off the image stabilization you turn that off that will also turn off ibis in the camera body as well so that's pretty much what i do whenever i'm vlogging or i'm doing anything handheld which a lot of my content i am all the way out at 15 so it's kind of an all or nothing you either have both of them turned on and you get that warping effect or you turn it off and you lose the ibis in the camera and you lose the stabilization on the lens which is honestly a huge bummer and a really big issue for me because the 15 to 35 is such a nice lens and part of the reason why it's so expensive it's around 2 400 usd is because it's a wide angle zoom that has image stabilization on it so the fact that i have to lose that is honestly a giant disappointment now i will say a lot of times if i'm shooting b-roll here in my office or something like that if you're punched in i would say pretty much anywhere over 24 millimeter especially all the way in at 35 or further you aren't gonna have any issues you can keep the ibis on in the camera and it's really going to help smooth out some of those shots that issue right there really upsets me about this camera it's probably my biggest gripe because it's just really unfortunate you pay all this money for this setup and this really amazing lens and then you just have to lose some of the upsides of it to just not get this crazy looking warping now next thing i want to talk about that you should consider about the r5 which is probably no surprise but i do want to address it and that is going to be the overheating now as i mentioned so far with the canon r5 in the first nine months we've had one firmware update which allowed the overheating meters if you want to call it that to be extended a little bit so honestly it really did help out quite a lot i experienced a little bit of overheating before that firmware update came out but after that firmware update honestly i've never had this camera completely overheat on me now you should keep in mind that i am pretty smart about how i film with this camera so i film all my stuff with this camera in the normal 4k i don't use the 4k hq because i know that eventually it will overheat in that mode i'm not shooting 8k um i really picked up this camera because i want to film everything in 4k whether it be 24 frames per second slow motion 60 or slow motion 120 i wanted to be able to film everything in 4k and honestly for me the normal 4k the non 4k hq still looks extremely good in my opinion now most of the time when i'm using this camera it is for my personal work for my youtube channel so a lot of times i have a sit-down interview style video like this where maybe i'm filming for i don't know between 20 and 45 minutes i guess depending on what the video is like and then after i film the a-roll i will then shoot some bursts of b-roll whether it be in 60 frames per second or in 120 frames per second so in that mode that's when i start seeing that timer for the overheating to start turning down so it's currently fine for me but it does make me a bit nervous sometimes and one thing i want to say about the overheating is like i mentioned i use this canon r5 mostly for my personal youtube channel here without a doubt if i was on a job or i was hired to do a job for a client where it was really important or for a good amount of money as much as i love this camera i wouldn't feel comfortable using this i would either need two camera bodies or you have to feel comfortable enough with the clients to say hey sorry we're gonna have to let this camera cool down and we can uh resume shooting in about i don't know 20 or 30 minutes so i don't know about you but i definitely do not feel comfortable doing that if it's just a camera you're gonna be using for yourself no problem but if you're like shooting weddings or with clients and you have moments where there's no way you want to miss it this camera probably isn't for you and that honestly sucks to say but it just really is at the end of the day what happens if you have to worry about your camera overheating now without a doubt i think the ibis wobble and the overheating are the biggest issues for me that you should consider when buying this camera there definitely are a couple other things as well one of those is the video files out of this camera are extremely clunky and tricky to edit with because of this certain codecs and the way this camera records 4k files it uses a compression that is h.265 instead of what the typical is in the past which was h.264 which i'm trying not to make this crazy technical but basically it just uses a newer compression method because the files are so large it basically destroys any computer that tries to edit this footage without making proxies now i myself i edit all my videos on a mac so previously i had a 2018 macbook pro that was fully specced out it could handle anything that you threw out it especially 4k footage but with this footage it destroyed that computer so i actually upgraded to one of the new m1 macbook pros but the new m1 max have this voodoo magic that they do to basically unpack this h.265 files really easily so with other people's testing this plays back super easy in davinci resolve and also in final cut now i myself along with i would say the majority of people out there still i'm a premiere pro user and as of now i'm filming this uh mid-march premiere pro still hasn't updated their system for the m1 computers so for now i still have to make proxies but hopefully premiere pro once it's updated for the m1 is going to be able to play back these video files smoothly without having to make proxies or anything like that i can't speak way too much from the pc side of things because i don't edit any of my footage on pc but from what i know it's still been an issue for a lot of other users that i'm friends with and that i've talked to so just keep in mind that you are going to have to add in some time to make proxies for a lot of your footage if you're shooting with r5 especially if you have any sort of an older machine or anything that's not like super high performance so last thing i would really tell people before they decide to pick up the canon r5 is i want to touch on the 120 frames per second footage in this camera now i personally think the 4k 120 out of this camera is extremely high quality i know some people have said the opposite of that before but i honestly just strongly disagree but shooting 120 in this camera there are some weird kind of quirks that you should know come with it you get absolutely zero audio recording which that might not be super important to you depending on how you film or what you're actually filming but there's been situations where i've worked with other people and you know i switch over to my slow motion mode and 120 and then something happens or if they say something that you can't replicate and you miss that moment and you just have to live with that fact so it just kind of comes with it if you shoot 120 in this camera you are going to have no audio so you just need to keep that in mind there is actually one other really weird quark and that is once you film that footage you load it up to your computer put it into your editing program it actually spits out that file as a 30 frames per second file now if you're someone like myself all of my projects are in a 24 frames per second timeline that is how i record all of my a-roll all my real-time footage is 23.976 so you film in 120 and it spits it out as a 30 frames per second clip no matter what you can't change that in the camera at all so there are workarounds you basically just have to select all the 120 frames per second files in your editing program and then you just change its speed to 80 which makes it then 24 frames per second and you're all good but it gets a little tricky and a little wonky when you you know film maybe a ton of clips maybe you have 60 clips some are 24 frames per second some are 60 frames per second then some you film in 120 frames per second which means it's really 30 frames per second clip and you need to go through and kind of match all of those to make it 24 frames especially if you're working in proxies you have to do these steps in the correct order otherwise if you make proxies first and then slow the footage down your proxies won't match up with what the actual footage is and then you go to export your video and the b-roll is just totally different sections of clip that you choose so it's honestly just a huge mess i finally figured out the workflow for it but it is just very particular and it does add a lot of extra steps every time you're trying to record video and trying to kind of just bang out a video quickly alright guys so that is pretty much it those are the big things i think everybody should know before picking up this camera for themself and i really am not trying to steer anyone away from this camera or trying to come off extremely negative but if you're talking about a camera body that's around 4 000 it's spending a ton of money so i think that you should at least have the correct expectations before picking up this camera and maybe if you're considering this camera i hope you found this video helpful again i want to say that this is an amazing camera still for both photo and video honestly it's exceptional at photography and also for the video side of things it's still amazing there's just a couple kind of asterisks and things that you should consider and see if that would kind of hinder your workflow or not but still an incredible all-in-one camera there aren't really a ton of cameras out there especially in this price point that is really good at photography and video on this level at least so it's just all things to consider but guys i would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below if you think the canon r5 if the issues are big enough you want to pick it up for yourself or maybe if you don't really think these things are a big issue and you would still love to have this camera be sure to check out my other canon r5 videos but i think that's gonna be it for me guys i hope you enjoyed watching and you found this video helpful if you did would you please drop this video a thumbs up if you're new around here consider subscribing i really appreciate it it really helps the channel out and i notice each and every single one but guys i'm out for now i will see you in the next video very very soon oh and one little fun fact i'm actually filming on the sony a7s3 today so maybe a video on that here soon too catch you guys in the next one peace [Music] you\"]\n",

      "Context:\n",
      " what's up everybody peter mckinnon here welcome back to yet another video and folks today we're talking about the canon r5 [Music] the highly anticipated much discussed rumored all the buzz and for a very good reason because this camera delivers i couldn't be more excited about it now before we dive into this thing and i talk about my experience and show you some footage because i have been shooting with it for a few months now canon sent me this camera on loan i'm giving it back actually in a few hours to test out basically in the middle of the pandemic but i want you to know too right at the beginning i'm sponsored by canon i'm an ambassador for the brand i'm a canon shooter i've been a canon shooter my entire life i've been shooting canon since i bought my first professional dslr that's about 15 years now i've been using canon products so keep that in mind when i'm doing this review i'm not going to be unfair about it if there are things i don't like about it i'm going to tell you but luckily for this camera it is exceptional and there's not a whole lot of things that i don't like about it so you're excited i'm excited let's talk about one of the biggest camera releases of the year of the is it of the decade could we say decade it's one of the biggest releases for canon for sure this is back to the 5d mark ii days let's talk about those days for a second hands up who remembers a filmmaker by the name of vincent laforay amazing made a film called reverie back in i'm gonna say it was like november 2008 with the 5d mark ii now this was one of the first times we'd seen cinematic looking footage with depth of field shot on a dslr that was a big deal then you had heavy hitters like philip bloom coming out with incredible courses on how to use a dslr as like a filmmaking camera in the right settings and the accessories and that will always be a staple in my mind learning from him when i was much younger that was a big deal for canon that was a huge camera release the 5d mark ii the r5 i feel and i think a lot of people would agree with me the r5 is that big deal of a release now for canon let's talk about why this camera is important why people are talking about it where all the buzz is coming from let me show you how this thing works there's the top down angle you've got your flip out screen that we've all come to love the body's a little bit thicker than the eos r not by a whole lot but that's obviously accounting for the new in body image stabilization the wheel is back the joystick is back the functionality that a lot of us are used to coming from the dslr side of things it makes it faster easier to use it just feels right here's something that'll make a lot of people happy dual card slots you've got a spot for a cf express which is the new type of like high-speed car that this thing's taking and then you have an sd card slot it takes the same lp e6 batteries that we've all have like 100 of so that is a massive benefit now there are new ones they've got this little sticker on them that's kind of how you're able to differentiate the new ones from the old ones and apparently it's just the software and the cameras is able to use this battery to just distribute the power in a more efficient way it's not necessarily that the battery's bigger and giving you more battery life but the camera and the software now is smarter and it's using these batteries better than the old ones same chargers that's good all right so taking a look at the difference in comparison of size to the r5 and the r here they are with the back button layout like i said this bar is gone you get your joystick here instead of your directional kind of d-pad sort of control you've got the wheel and other than that they look pretty much the same this r5 is just a little bit thicker so if we look at them both side by side a little bit fatter grip's a little bit bigger we flip them over on the sides this side right here is a really good representation of how much thicker it is most of everything in the same place another top down honestly in my opinion it feels better ergonomically so now you've got ibis in the body you've got image stabilization in the lens those two things working together to get you some super stable footage something people have wanted for a long time it's one of those instances where you're reading the stats online and you're like this can't be true is this right does this do 8k raw c-log with autofocus 4k 120 yep i mean when we're even looking at all the modes on this camera as far as how they're represented within the menu canon's menus have always been good but the ui within how to get to different frame rates and resolutions has been improved even more now they've just broken it down into three menu options basically it's very clearly broken down here which makes it a breeze to just go boop boop boop and you know exactly what you're setting now to get that high frame rate you're still going to go over to the other menu hit high frame rate enable that's going to go into 4k 120. photographers 45 megapixels right i've been shooting on 20 megapixels with the 1dx mark ii for like a good quarter plus of my entire career so 45 megapixels that's great that's some high-res stuff right there one of the things i love i love the shutter sound and click of this camera that's a big thing if it's just like a nasty shutter sound and click can't do it this that's subtle check this out shutter mode electronic listen to this everybody just shot like 15 frames there's so many times in photography where that shutter sound can actually be an issue wildlife photography for example if you're someone that's camping out and you're waiting for a hummingbird or you're waiting for an animal gone with this you're not even sure if you shot the frame it's so silent so that is amazing you're shooting live events weddings any type of thing where people are talking and the focus is not on you it's on something else and you're needing to photograph that without being a distraction amazing frames per second wise this thing is fast you're going to get 12 frames per second mechanical you're going to get 20 frames per second when you're in live view so it rips in live view mode one two three see the border right there see that white frame just freaking out that's how fast it's shooting that was a hundred and thirty photos i just snapped you heard nothing that's got to be one of my favorite new features because i used that on the 1dx mark iii constantly you're dropping something in a tank of water you're shooting john hill do a fakie 360 flip nose grind into a kickflip manual and shove it out switch you want to capture these moments without having to worry about like did i get it in frame 20 frames per second if you didn't get it in frame there's a whole different issue so let's talk about my experience using this r5 since pete you've clearly had it for quite some time now tell me what it's like i know the specs i see them i've read them all those things how is the camera dude how is it i'll start by saying i got this camera like in the thick of the lockdown i didn't get a chance to use it as much as i wanted to because parks were closed trails were closed no one was going outside so a lot of the use that i got from the r5 at the beginning for like the bulk of the time that i had it in my possession was stuff at home photographing the pets photographing the kids doing things like that around the house things that you do when you first get a camera at home and you open the box and you're like uh come here boy it felt so good to shoot 120 frames per second again used it all the time on the 1dx mark ii got used to shooting 60p on the eos r but it was really good to shoot in 120 again and remember how good it looks and how good it looks in 4k insane now the version i have is a prototype version it's not a finished production version that's why it has the words sample on it and this is the one i've had for a few months so there were some quirks and things to it that i think will be ironed out when the launch version comes and there was also a couple things that i was unsure of example if you're shooting a lot of 4k 120 sometimes the camera starts to overheat and gives you that overheat warning just so that the things inside don't melt and it doesn't get destroyed when you think of a cinema series camera like the c500 and up those all have huge fans built into them but we're talking a mirrorless camera here this is this is very small this little thing doesn't have two giant fans cooling it down the entire time so it gets hot of course the more shooting that you do you're gonna have to wait so it makes sense to me that it overheats based off those settings that you're shooting at for me though that is one of the downsides i understand having to wait for the camera to cool down i don't want to wait i just want to keep shooting i don't think there's there's x if you shoot this much you have to wait this long because it's all situational it's gonna depend on different conditions are you shooting in the jungle where it's super hot and humid and all you're doing is 8k and 4k 120 are you shooting in the arctic where it's the complete opposite are you not shooting much 4k 120 maybe just a few clips here and there you're never going to have an issue so it all depends on the project the place the conditions it's entirely situational but it is one of those things that you're gonna have to keep in mind when you're shooting just in case i don't think it'll be anything drastic or anything to really worry about it just makes sense to protect the camera from the inside so the whole thing doesn't melt because let's be honest this tiny little package right here is shooting 8k raw which is incredible for a little mirrorless camera magic it looks like we're shooting on a cinema camera it looks that good so we were just incredibly impressed and inspired having that kind of quality in a tiny body like this plus getting that dual pixel auto focus being able to do all of those types of things that we typically want to shoot without having to worry about pulling focus like you do on a cinema camera being able to have that 8k feature that 4k 120 in log mode while still taking advantage of the dual pixel autofocus system that's that is huge that's massive that opens up so many doors you basically don't even need a gimbal when you're using this camera obviously gimbals have their place depending on the types of moves and types of shots you want to do but for the most part i always try to get away without having to use one without having to bring one an extreme example of that is a few weeks ago i was hanging out the side of a razor side by side with the pro driver up north he was going like 130 140 down this crazy dirt road and drifting corners and i was just hand holding this with one hand because the other was holding on for life and i was trying to vlog that whole thing with the ibis with the image stabilization i mean it looks fantastic and that's not even in slow motion i i don't see the need to even bring a gimbal when you travel or any of those things it's it's just so good let's talk about the price you're looking at for the body only 52.99 now that's canadian dollars that's important to say if you're watching this anywhere else do the math look it up that is a good price to get a camera that packs as much punch as a cinema camera in a lot of instances in a package this small think about travel think about portability you can take this anywhere this flies under the radar this doesn't look like you're shooting professional looking 8k raw footage you get a big cinema camera you go in somewhere sorry that can't whatever you guys are doing in here it's not allowed it's a school project no it's not a school project this is going to get into those places this thing is portable it's small it's inconspicuous a camera that's over five thousand dollars is not a cheap camera by any means that's a lot of money given that i think it's warranted based off what you're getting inside this if that's out of your wheelhouse don't be worried there's another option for you that's the new r6 camera now if you want to learn more about this and the cost and all the features and things compared to the r5 you can watch this video right here so the fact now that i can shoot a vlog in 4k at 10 bit 422 internal the amount of information that this camera is recording it looks like i'm editing cinema camera footage that's because this camera packs so much inside so i've had people ask like will you be switching to the r5 and yes i'll be switching to this camera this will be my new main driver daily driver travel camera if i'm vlogging if i'm making short films i'm gonna be shooting them on this because it packs so much in such a small footprint and there's so many things in here that i've been waiting for in a camera for years well done guys seriously well done all right guys so that is it for me that's your first look at the canon eos r5 from someone that's been using it for a few weeks and had hands on for a few months now i hope you got something out of that i hope that was a good representation of the camera you got to see some of the specs you get to see some of the footage used what it looks like what it looks like uploaded to youtube after it's been compressed all of those things i hope it was helpful and i hope mostly that you enjoyed it so thanks for sticking around i appreciate you watching and thanks to canon for sending me those cameras early i had a blast i'll see you guys in the next one peace when you hear the word artist you might think of a painter a museum fancy degree when i hear the word artist i think of my friends the local restaurant owner a little kid sitting under a blanket with a flashlight dreaming of the stars [Music] you\n",
