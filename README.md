Utilizing Pinecone to query relevant contexts and retrieve pertinent information.
Employing an OpenAI generative model to generate answers backed by real data sources.
Implementing fine-tuning of the Language Model (LLM) on specialized text data, including articles and papers on sentence transformers and semantic search training methods.
Exploring Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as an alternative approach, integrating information retrieval components into the generation process for improved accuracy.
Building a comprehensive Knowledge Base as an external long-term memory for the LLM.
Leveraging dense vector embeddings, numerical representations of sentence meaning, to retrieve semantically related information.
Utilizing state-of-the-art tools such as open source sentence transformers or OpenAI's ada-002 model to create dense vectors.
This project showcases my expertise in advanced natural language processing techniques, information retrieval, generative models, and knowledge base development. By integrating these methods, I have demonstrated the ability to optimize information retrieval processes and generate accurate responses backed by relevant data sources.
